# System Design Notes

A growing collection of my personal notes on system design — covering fundamentals, patterns, and real-world architectures.  
Currently building this up gradually; more detailed templates and case studies will come soon.

> Work in progress 🚧 — I'll add structured designs (URL shortener, feed system, etc.) once fundamentals are done.
